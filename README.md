##  Dataset Preparation

Please download paired medical images from the [Harvard Medical School website](https://www.med.harvard.edu/AANLIB/home.html).
Organize the dataset into the following structure under `Medical_dataset_test/`:

```
Medical_dataset_test/
├── MRI-CT/
│   ├── MRI/
│   └── CT/
├── MRI-PET/
│   ├── MRI/
│   └── PET/
└── MRI-SPECT/
    ├── MRI/
    └── SPECT/
```

##  Usage

1. Download pretrained model weights from: **\[[link to be provided](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1kCttUIk-AOzc_IMlUcWM_g?pwd=wr5a)]**
   Place the model file in the `checkpoints/` directory.

2. Run inference:

```bash
python test.py
```

3. Results will be saved in the `test_result/` folder.
